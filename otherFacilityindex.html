Indeed, for a very small segment of the high school population, excelling in a sport, and thus being recruited to participate in intercollegiate sports, can and does translate into fantastic college opportunities, including, in some cases, scholarships.Students do not have to shy away from detailing these experiences and what they learned from them — they just have to shift the lens, add another layer, or approach these topics from creative perspectives to make them both original and reflective of a greater range of interests and talents. For example, maybe your experience diving for the ball as a volleyball player allowed you to take a risk in applying for the job of your dreams. Perhaps the qualities needed to be a good basketball player and also the skills needed to command a boardroom</p>
